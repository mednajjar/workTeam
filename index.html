        <h2>The Gingerbread Man</h2>
        <p>This is the fast paced tale of the Gingerbread Man who leapt out of the oven and ran away.<br> In the 1890 version by Joseph Jacobs, <b>the hero was Johnny-Cake</b>the hero was Johnny-Cake, but we have changed him to the more familiar Gingerbread Man.<br>          
            Once upon a time there was an old man, an old woman, and a little boy. One morning the old woman made some gingerbread in the shape of a man. She added icing for his hair and clothes, and little blobs of dough for his nose and eyes. When she put him in the oven to bake, she said to the little boy, "You watch the gingerbread man while your grandfather and I go out to work in the garden."</p>
